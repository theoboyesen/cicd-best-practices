| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test: add validation for DynamoDB schema` |
 
## Pull Request Process
 
1. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
2. Make changes and commit with conventional messages
3. Push and open a PR with a conventional title
4. CI pipeline runs automatically — all checks must pass
5. Get at least one approval from a reviewer
6. Squash merge to `main`
7. CD pipeline runs and waits for production approval
 
## CI Pipeline Checks
 
Every PR must pass these checks before merge:
 
- **Terraform Format** — `terraform fmt -check`
- **Terraform Validate** — `terraform validate`
- **Security Scan** — tfsec checks for misconfigurations
- **Terraform Plan** — plan output posted as PR comment
 
## Deployment
 
Merges to `main` trigger the CD pipeline:
1. Automatic `terraform plan`
2. **Manual approval required** in the `production` environment
3. `terraform apply` executes after approval
 
## Security
 
- Never commit `.tfvars` files with real values
- Use GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials
- All S3 buckets must have encryption and public access blocks
- DynamoDB tables must enable encryption and point-in-time recovery
